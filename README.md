# Functions in JS

This is mostly me playing around at building a functional library in JavaScript.

Somewhat inspired by Brian Lonsdorf's talk, [Hey Underscore, You're Doing
It Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3svKOdZijA).

## Setup & Testing

```
$ npm install
$ make test
```

Running individual tests

```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/mocha --ui tdd -g "regex"
```

> You can also install mocha globally with `npm install -g mocha`.
